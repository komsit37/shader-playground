# Manga Slash Forge Simple

**Simplified working version of Manga Slash Forge for debugging**

This is a simplified version that should work properly:
- Simple radial slashes for typing (4 lines at 90Â° intervals)
- Simple flowing line for navigation
- No complex loops or mathematical operations
- Basic orange forge effects and purple flow effects

If this works, we can gradually add complexity back to identify what was causing the white canvas issue.
