‚è∫ You have significant flexibility in designing shader effects! Based on the codebase
structure, here's what you can do:

Complete Creative Freedom

Visual Effects:

- Any mathematical function or algorithm you can implement in GLSL
- Complex particle systems, fluid simulations, fractals, noise patterns
- Multi-layered effects with different blend modes
- Time-based animations with custom easing functions
- Physics simulations (springs, gravity, collisions)

Color Systems:

- Full RGB/HSV color manipulation
- Custom color palettes and gradients
- Dynamic color changes based on movement, time, or position
- Transparency and alpha blending effects

Available Inputs

Cursor State:

- iCurrentCursor - current position and dimensions
- iPreviousCursor - previous position and dimensions
- iTimeCursorChange - when cursor last moved
- iTime - global time for animations
- iResolution - screen resolution
- fragCoord - current pixel position

Background:

- iChannel0 - the terminal background texture (in actual use)
- Can read existing pixels to blend with

Mathematical Tools

Built-in Functions:

- Trigonometry: sin, cos, tan, atan2
- Exponentials: exp, log, pow, sqrt
- Noise functions: custom implementations
- Distance functions: distance, length, dot
- Smoothing: smoothstep, mix, clamp

Custom Functions:

- SDF (Signed Distance Fields) for complex shapes
- Procedural noise for organic effects
- Custom easing curves
- Bezier curves and splines

Examples of What's Possible

Already Implemented:

- Lightning bolts with branching
- Smooth lighting trails
- Rainbow color cycling
- Bounce physics with particles
- Digital dissolve/teleportation
- Pulsing focus effects
- Water flow simulation

Could Be Added:

- Fire/flame effects
- Plasma/energy fields
- Geometric patterns
- Particle explosions
- Liquid metal effects
- Neon/cyberpunk styles
- Nature effects (leaves, snow, etc.)
- Abstract art patterns

Limitations

Performance:

- Runs in real-time, so complex calculations need optimization
- Fragment shader runs per-pixel, so efficiency matters

GLSL Constraints:

- No dynamic loops (loop counts must be compile-time constants)
- Limited precision on some operations
- No recursion

Terminal Context:

- Should work well on dark backgrounds
- Avoid effects that make text hard to read
- Consider color-blind users

The shader system is very flexible - you're essentially writing a small graphics program that
runs on the GPU for each pixel!
