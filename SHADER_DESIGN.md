‚è∫ You have significant flexibility in designing shader effects! Based on the codebase
structure, here's what you can do:

Complete Creative Freedom

Visual Effects:

- Any mathematical function or algorithm you can implement in GLSL
- Complex particle systems, fluid simulations, fractals, noise patterns
- Multi-layered effects with different blend modes
- Time-based animations with custom easing functions
- Physics simulations (springs, gravity, collisions)

Color Systems:

- Full RGB/HSV color manipulation
- Custom color palettes and gradients
- Dynamic color changes based on movement, time, or position
- Transparency and alpha blending effects

Available Inputs

Cursor State:
- Current and previous cursor position/dimensions
- Timing information for animations
- Screen resolution and pixel coordinates
- Terminal background texture for blending

Movement Analysis:
Effects can adapt based on cursor movement patterns - subtle trails for typing, dramatic effects for navigation jumps.

Mathematical Tools:
- Full GLSL function library (trigonometry, exponentials, etc.)
- Custom SDF and noise functions for complex shapes
- Procedural generation capabilities

Examples of What's Possible

Already Implemented:

- Lightning bolts with branching
- Smooth lighting trails
- Rainbow color cycling
- Bounce physics with particles
- Digital dissolve/teleportation
- Pulsing focus effects
- Water flow simulation

Could Be Added:

- Fire/flame effects
- Plasma/energy fields
- Geometric patterns
- Particle explosions
- Liquid metal effects
- Neon/cyberpunk styles
- Nature effects (leaves, snow, etc.)
- Abstract art patterns

Limitations

Performance:
- Real-time execution requires optimization
- Fragment shader runs per-pixel

GLSL Constraints:
- No dynamic loops or recursion
- Limited precision on some operations

Terminal Context:
- Must work on dark backgrounds
- Cannot interfere with text readability
- Should consider accessibility

The shader system is very flexible - you're essentially writing a small graphics program that runs on the GPU for each pixel!
